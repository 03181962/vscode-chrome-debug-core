# Notes
This is the demo app from the Angular 2 tutorial here - https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/

The original code is here - https://github.com/johnpapa/angular2-tour-of-heroes. The only change to get it to run with this extension was adding the launch.json file.

Open VS Code to this directory to try it out. Follow the original instructions below to start it up, then press F5 in Code to launch it in Chrome and debug. (If Chrome can't load the page, you may need to change the url in the launch.json, since it uses lite-server defaults).


# Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo

1. Use `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies

1. Run the TypeScript compiler, watch for changes, start the server, and launch the browser by using `npm start`
